Agile-DevOps-Bridge (ADB) Framework
🎯 Overview
The ADB Framework is an open-source Operational Methodology designed to synchronize Product Management cycles with DevOps velocity. It solves the "Black Box" problem where Product Owners lack visibility into technical debt and deployment risks.

📦 What's Inside?
The SLO-to-Backlog Connector: A tool that syncs Prometheus/Grafana alerts directly into Jira/GitHub Issues as "High Priority" debt.

Definition of Ready (DoR) 2.0: A standardized template for "Cloud-Native User Stories."

The Velocity Adjuster: An Excel/Python model that calculates "True Team Capacity" by factoring in automated testing cycles and deployment lead times.
